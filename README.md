# DHBW Mosbach INF19X - Advanced Software Engineering

This is a project for the course INF19X at DHBW Mosbach in Advanced Software Engineering hold by Prof. Dr. Carsten MÃ¼ller.  
The project is based on the travelling salesman problem.
The objective is to find the shortest path between all cities with BruteForce and Swarm Optimization Algorithms.


## Specification of the Task

**Complex task | 55 points**

- The processing of this task takes place in a team with two students, in the exception a team with 3 students.

- **Implementation:** Java 17.0.2 | no modeling | no JUnit tests

- **Application 01** | 10 points
  - For the problem definition TSP with the data instance [a280](src/resources/a280.tsp) 
  a console application for the search with BruteForce.

- **Application 02** | 30 points
  - For the problem TSP with the data instance [a280](src/resources/a280.tsp) a console application for parallelized optimization
  for **parallelized optimization** with either **Particle Swarm Optimization**,
  **Ant Colony Optimization** or **Artificial Bee Colony**.
  - The search of the agents Particle, Ant or Bee is done with powerful technologies
  from the package **java.util.concurrent**.
  - The parameters are to be optimized in such a way that with respect to the well-known
  **Optimium 2579** a solution quality of at **least 95%** is reached.
  - The swarm behavior is to be logged in a log file in a comprehensible way.
  
- **Application 03** | 15 points
  - For the problem TSP with the data instance [a280](src/resources/a280.tsp) a console application is to be developed
  for the **parallelized search of a best possible parameter configuration for the algorithm
  algorithm** used in application 02. The best possible parameter configuration is stored in a JSON file.
  - The console application for application 02 is to be extended so that via command line
  `- best [filename]` to specify or apply the JSON file.
